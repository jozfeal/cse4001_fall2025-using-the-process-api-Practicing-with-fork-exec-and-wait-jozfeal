# Assignment: Practicing the Process API
Practicing with fork, exec, wait. 

### Overview

In this assignment, you will practice using the Process API to create processes and run programs under Linux. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with system calls related to process management. Specifically, you will practice using the unix process API functions 'fork()', 'exec()', 'wait()', and 'exit()'. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is not an OS/161 assignment. You will complete it directly on Linux. 

Use the Linux in your CSE4001 container. If you are using macOS, you may use the Terminal (you may need to install development tools with C/C++ compilers).

### Questions
1. Write a program that calls `fork()`. Before calling `fork()`, have the main process access a variable (e.g., x) and set its value to something (e.g., 100). What value is the variable in the child process? What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of x?


```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    // variable to check for change
    int x = 100;

    int rc = fork();
    if (rc < 0) {
        // fork failed; exit
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    } else if (rc == 0) {
        // first print var to check if it has changed from initialization
        printf("Child value of x: %d\n", x);
        // change value and check again
        x = 150;
        printf("Child value of x after change: %d\n", x);
    } else {
        // same check as child with different value
        printf("Parent value of x: %d\n", x);
        x = 50;
        printf("Parent value of x after change: %d\n", x);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

```
On execution, the value of "x" on the child and parent were 100, just like in the intialization,
which means tha the value was copied onto the child, since it is an almost identical copy.
After changing the value of the variable, the following print would correctly display the new value.
No matter if the parent or child process ran first, the value of the other process was not affected
since all the variables are stored in different places, even if the value is the same,
so the value was 100 for the other process. Once again, the value would change after updating it.
```


2. Write a program that opens a file (with the `open()` system call) and then calls `fork()` to create a new process. Can both the child and parent access the file descriptor returned by `open()`? What happens when they are writing to the file concurrently, i.e., at the same time?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```

3. Write another program using `fork()`.The child process should print ‚Äúhello‚Äù; the parent process should print ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù. You should try to ensure that the child process always prints first; can you do this without calling `wait()` in the parent?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```


4. Write a program that calls `fork()` and then calls some form of `exec()` to run the program `/bin/ls`. See if you can try all of the variants of `exec()`, including (on Linux) `execl()`, `execle()`, `execlp()`, `execv()`, `execvp()`, and `execvpe()`. Why do you think there are so many variants of the same basic call?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```

5. Now write a program that uses `wait()` to wait for the child process to finish in the parent. What does `wait()` return? What happens if you use `wait()` in the child?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```

6. Write a slight modification of the previous program, this time using `waitpid()` instead of `wait()`. When would `waitpid()` be useful?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```

7. Write a program that creates a child process, and then in the child closes standard output (`STDOUT FILENO`). What happens if the child calls `printf()` to print some output after closing the descriptor?

```cpp
// Add your code or answer here. You can also add screenshots showing your program's execution.  
```
